"""
Write a Python program that can simulate a simple calculator, using the
console as the exclusive input and output device. That is, each input to the
calculator, be it a number, like 12.34 or 1034, or an operator, like + or =,
can be done on a separate line. After each such input, you should output
to the Python console what would be displayed on your calculator.
