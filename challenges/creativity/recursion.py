# What is Recursion?
"""
Recursion occurs when a function calls itself so that it can break problems into small
manageable parts. There are two main components of recursion.
1. Base case: A condition at which a recursion stops.
2. Recursive case: The function calls itself with an argument that moves it towards the
base case.
