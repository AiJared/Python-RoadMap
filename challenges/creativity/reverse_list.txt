Write a pseudo-code description of a function that reverses a list of n
integers, so that the numbers are listed in the opposite order than they
were before, and compare this method to an equivalent Python function
for doing the same thing.

PROCESS reverse_list(n)
    result_list is []
    
    FOR i in range(len(n)-1 down to 0)
        APPEND n[i] to result_list
    
    RETURN result_list
