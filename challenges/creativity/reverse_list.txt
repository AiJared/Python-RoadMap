Write a pseudo-code description of a function that reverses a list of n
integers, so that the numbers are listed in the opposite order than they
were before, and compare this method to an equivalent Python function
for doing the same thing.

PROCESS reverse_list(n)
    result_list is []

    FOR i, j in enumerate(n)
        IF i is 0
            APPEND j to result_list
            INCREMENT i
    RETURN result_list
