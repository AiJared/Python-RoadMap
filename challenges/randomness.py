# Randomness
"""
Define a function, random_number, that takes no parameters. 
The function must generate a random integer between 1 and 100, both inclusive, and return it.

Calling the function multiple times should (usually) return different numbers.

For example, calling random_number() some times might first return 42, then 63, then 1.
