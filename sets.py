# What is a set
"""
A set is an unorderd sequence/collection of unique/distinct items.
This means that:

1. Set does not have duplicates
2. It is unordered meaning that you cannot access items using index numbers as you would in list

"""

# Key Properties of a Set:
"""
1. Unique - All the elements of a set are not the same. If you try to an existing element it
won't be added.
2. Unordered - All the elements in a set are not in any order. Meaning that you cannot rely
on order when iterating through a set or printing its elements.
3. Mutable - You can add or remove elements from a set.
