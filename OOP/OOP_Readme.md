# Object-Oriented Programming

## What is Object-Oriented Programming?

**Objects** are the real deal in object-oriented programming. An object is an **instance** of a **class**. A class presents to the outside world a concise and consistent view of the objects that are its instances in a simple and direct manner possible while not showing the inner workings of the objects or in this case its instances.

The definition of the class specifies **instance variables** which are also called **data members** that the object has and **methods**, which are also called **member functions**, that the object can execute.
