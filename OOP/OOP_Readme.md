# Object-Oriented Programming

## What is Object-Oriented Programming?

**Objects** are the real deal in object-oriented programming. An object is an **instance** of a **class**. A class presents to the outside world a concise and consistent view of the objects that are its instances in a simple and direct manner possible while not showing the inner workings of the objects or in this case its instances.

The definition of the class specifies **instance variables** which are also called **data members** that the object has and **methods**, which are also called **member functions**, that the object can execute.

### Object-Oriented Design Goals

Software implementations should achieve **robustness**, **adaptability** and **reusability**.

1. **Robustness**

This is the ability of software to handle unexpected inputs that are not explicitly defined for its application. For example, if a program is expecting a positive integer(perhaps representing the price of an item) and instead it is given a negative integer, then the program should be able to revocer gracefully from this error.

2. **Adaptability**

Software needs to be able to evolve over time in response to changing conditions in its environment. That is why adaptability, also known as **evolvability** is a very important goal of object-oriented design. Related to this concept is **portability**, which is the ability of software to run with minimal change on different hardware and operating system platforms. Python has a great advantage of being portable that is why it is very efficient in writing software.

3. **Reusability**

Software should be reusable, that is, the same code should be usable as a component of different systems in various applications. Developing quality software can be an expesive enterprise and its cost can be offset somewhat if the software is designed in a way that makes it easily reusable in future applications.

### Object-Oriented Design Principles

Below are the object-oriented design principles which intend ti facilitate the goals outlines above.

- Modularity
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation

1. **Modularity**

Modularity refers to an organizing principle in which different components of a software system are divided into separate functional units.

Using modularity in software system can alsi provide a powerful organizing framework that brings clarity to an implementation.
